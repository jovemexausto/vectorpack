# Pricing and packaging memo

Pricing should track the value of faster decision making, not storage.

The business model is a registry subscription with usage-based query costs. The pack format itself stays open so teams can self-host if they want.

For go-to-market, the entry tier is a free public registry for open knowledge packs. The paid tier adds private packs, access controls, and query-on-registry for internal teams.

We should avoid a separate "enterprise" plan until we have proof of scale needs. The premium value comes from reliable query quality and reproducibility, not from a sales process.
