# Roadmap memo

Short term we need real embeddings and a usable CLI. That unlocks the first real demo: build a pack and query it with meaningful results.

Mid term we need a registry that can push and pull packs. The registry makes the format social and shareable, and enables query-on-registry for verified packs.

Longer term we swap in the Rust engine for performance and publish adapters for more languages.

The roadmap is not a list of features. It is a sequence of proofs:
- proof that the artifact is reproducible
- proof that queries are useful
- proof that packs can be shared and reused
