# Product vision memo

We win by being the default "knowledge compiler" for teams that already have a lot of docs but no way to make them queryable and portable.

The core promise is simple:
- build once
- query anywhere
- ship knowledge like a package

This is not a chatbot. It is a reproducible artifact. If a pack builds from a manifest today, it must build the same byte-for-byte artifact tomorrow. That is the trust anchor.

Target users:
- platform and data teams who maintain internal docs
- product orgs with many artifacts but no search quality
- OSS maintainers who want a queryable knowledge base

We will say no to features that are not about portability or reproducibility. If it does not make a pack more portable, it is out of scope.
