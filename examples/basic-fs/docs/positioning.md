# Positioning memo

VectorPack is the package manager for knowledge, not another RAG tool.

The differentiation is that the output is a portable, verifiable artifact. Most RAG pipelines are process-heavy and non-reproducible. VectorPack makes a build pipeline deterministic and shareable.

Competitors focus on hosted search. We focus on a standard format and a build system that can be run anywhere.

The single sentence positioning:
"Compile your knowledge into a portable artifact, then query it anywhere."
